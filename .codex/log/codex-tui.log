+# Specify Poker Constitution
 
 ## Core Principles
 
-### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
-<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
-[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
-<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->
+### I. Secure Multi-Device Access
+Players MUST authenticate to access games across devices. Account linking, session
+management, and device revocation MUST be supported to prevent unauthorized access.
+Rationale: Fair gameplay depends on trustworthy identity and secure continuity.
 
-### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
-<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
-[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
-<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->
+### II. Real-Time State Sync & Push
+All game state changes MUST be synchronized in real time for every player and
+delivered via push notifications. Server-authoritative state and ordered events
+MUST prevent divergence across devices. Rationale: The experience is only fair
+when everyone sees the same game state at the same time.
 
-### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
-<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
-[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
-<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->
+### III. Telemetry & Behavioral Observability
+Telemetry MUST be collected for core user flows and game events using a defined
+event schema. The system MUST minimize sensitive data while preserving analytical
+value. Rationale: The product must be observable to understand real usage.
 
-### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
-<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
-[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
-<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->
+### IV. Deterministic Game Rules
+Game rules MUST be deterministic: the same inputs and seeded randomness MUST
+produce the same outputs across all clients. Determinism MUST be verifiable via
+tests and replayable event logs. Rationale: Determinism underpins fairness.
 
-### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
-<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
-[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
-<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->
+### V. No Platform Payments
+The game MUST NOT support on-platform payments or in-app purchases. Rationale:
+The experience must remain payment-free and free of platform billing complexity.
 
-## [SECTION_2_NAME]
-<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->
-
-[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
-<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->
+## Product Constraints
+
+- Gameplay requires authenticated access; anonymous sessions are not permitted.
+- Realtime sync MUST use push notifications in addition to realtime channels.
+- Telemetry events MUST be documented with ownership, purpose, and retention.
+- Client behavior MUST be resilient to reconnects without state divergence.
+- No payment, wallet, or checkout flows are allowed in any client.
 
-## [SECTION_3_NAME]
-<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->
-
-[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
-<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->
+## Delivery & Quality Gates
+
+- Deterministic rules MUST have unit tests covering seeded scenarios.
+- Sync logic MUST have integration tests for reconnects and out-of-order events.
+- Telemetry MUST be validated for schema correctness before release.
+- Push notification behavior MUST be verified on each supported platform.
 
 ## Governance
-<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->
 
-[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
-<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
+- This constitution supersedes other guidance when conflicts arise.
+- Amendments require a documented proposal, rationale, and version bump per
+  semantic versioning (MAJOR for removals or redefinitions, MINOR for additions,
+  PATCH for clarifications).
+- All plans, specs, and tasks MUST include a compliance check against these
+  principles before implementation begins.
+- Compliance reviews occur at feature planning and pre-release checkpoints.

 ## Constitution Check
 
 *GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
 
-[Gates determined based on constitution file]
+- Secure multi-device access plan (auth, session revocation, device linking)
+- Realtime state sync design using push notifications
+- Telemetry event schema and collection plan

+**Feature Branch**: `001-poker-mvp`  
+**Created**: 2026-01-09  
+**Status**: Draft  
+**Input**: User description: "Build a web-based poker website (MVP) for play-money
+Texas Hold’em. Users: - Users can create a nickname and avatar. - Authenticate
+users using keycloak. - Support logging in with google accounts. - Basic
+profiles: nickname, avatar, stats (hands played, wins), and a friends list
+(optional). Player flows: 1) Landing page → “Enter Lobby” 2) Lobby shows tables
+with: table name, blinds, max players, seats taken, and whether a hand is in
+progress. 3) Create table: set table name, blinds (small/big), max players (2–9),
+and starting chip stack (play money). 4) Join table: choose a seat if open. If a
+hand is in progress, join as spectator until next hand. In-table experience: -
+Table layout: seats around the table, community cards, pot, dealer button, player
+action controls. - Player actions: fold, check/call, bet/raise with a chip slider
+and presets (½ pot, pot, all-in). - Timers: each player has X seconds to act; if
+timer expires, auto-fold (or check when legal). - Chat: simple text chat per
+table. Game rules: - Correct Texas Hold’em rules: blinds, dealing, betting
+rounds, hand evaluation, side pots, showdown, split pots. - Deterministic state
+machine: the same inputs always produce the same game state. - Handle
+disconnects: if a player disconnects during a hand, auto-fold when action is
+required; allow reconnect. Non-functional: - Real-time updates (table state
+should feel instant). - Prevent obvious cheating: server-authoritative game
+state, no client deciding outcomes. - Auditability: keep an event log per hand
+(actions + timestamps) for debugging. - Basic moderation controls for table
+owner: kick a player, mute chat. Out of scope (explicitly): - Real money,
+payments, cashout - Multi-table tournaments - Complex auth (email/password),
+compliance features"
+
+## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*
+
+### User Story 1 - Join & Play a Hand (Priority: P1)
+
+As a player, I can enter the lobby, join a table, receive real-time updates, and
+play a complete hand of Texas Hold’em with legal actions only.
+
+**Why this priority**: Core gameplay is the MVP value; without it the product
+does not deliver.
+
+**Independent Test**: A single player can join a table with bots or test users,
+play a full hand through showdown, and see the correct winner and chip updates.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** an authenticated user in the lobby, **When** they join an open seat,
+   **Then** the table view loads and shows their seat, stack, and action controls.
+2. **Given** an active hand, **When** it is the user's turn to act, **Then** only
+   legal actions are presented and the action updates the table state for all
+   players in real time.
+
+---
+
+### User Story 2 - Create & Manage a Table (Priority: P2)
+
+As a player, I can create a new table with play-money settings and manage basic
+moderation controls for my table.
+
+**Why this priority**: Table creation is required to start new games and manage
+the session quality.
+
+**Independent Test**: A user creates a table, joins a seat, and can remove or
+mute another test user without affecting other tables.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** an authenticated user in the lobby, **When** they create a table,
+   **Then** the table appears in the lobby list with its settings and occupancy.
+2. **Given** the table owner is seated, **When** they kick or mute a player,
+   **Then** the affected player is removed or muted for that table only.
+
+---
+
+### User Story 3 - Profiles & Social Context (Priority: P3)
+
+As a player, I can set a nickname and avatar and view basic profile stats in the
+table and lobby.
+
+**Why this priority**: Identity and stats improve the social experience but are
+not required to complete a hand.
+
+**Independent Test**: A user updates nickname/avatar and sees them reflected in
+the lobby and table without impacting gameplay.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they update their nickname or
+   avatar, **Then** the updated profile appears in the lobby and table.
+
+---
+
+### Edge Cases
+
+- Player disconnects while it is their turn to act.
+- Player reconnects after missing updates and must resync state.
+- All players but one fold before showdown.
+- Two or more players tie and the pot must be split.
+- A player attempts an illegal action (out of turn, insufficient chips).
+- A spectator joins mid-hand and must not see private hole cards.
+- Table owner disconnects while moderation controls are needed.
+
+## Constitution Requirements *(mandatory)*
+
+- **Secure multi-device access**: Only authenticated users can access the lobby
+  and tables; sessions can be revoked per user.
+- **Realtime sync + push**: Live table updates are delivered instantly; players
+  receive out-of-band turn notifications to stay in sync across devices.
+- **Telemetry**: Core events are captured for logins, table creation/join,
+  actions, hand outcomes, and disconnects under a defined schema.
+- **Deterministic rules**: Game progression follows a deterministic state
+  machine with replayable event logs.
+- **No platform payments**: The MVP uses play-money only and includes no payment
+  or cashout flows.
+
+## Requirements *(mandatory)*
+
+### Functional Requirements
+
+- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users via Keycloak and allow Google login.
+- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to set a nickname and avatar.
+- **FR-003**: System MUST show a lobby listing available tables with name, blinds,

+- **FR-007**: System MUST enforce Texas Hold’em rules, including blinds, betting
+  rounds, side pots, and showdown outcomes.
+- **FR-008**: System MUST be server-authoritative so the client cannot decide
+  outcomes or alter game state.
+- **FR-009**: System MUST update table state for all players in real time.
+- **FR-010**: System MUST apply a turn timer and auto-fold or auto-check on expiry.

+  spectators.
+- **FR-015**: System MUST allow players to reconnect and resync their current
+  table state.

+  unused without impacting gameplay.
+- **FR-017**: System MUST provide turn notifications to keep multi-device users
+  in sync when they are not actively viewing the table.
+
+### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
+
+- **UserProfile**: User identity, nickname, avatar, stats, and friends list.
+- **Table**: Table configuration, seats, owner, and current status.
+- **Seat**: Player occupancy, stack, and status at a table.
+- **Hand**: Hand lifecycle, community cards, pot(s), and outcome.
+- **HandEvent**: Timestamped game actions for audit and replay.
+- **ChatMessage**: Per-table message with author and timestamp.
+
+## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*
+
+### Measurable Outcomes
+
+- **SC-001**: 95% of users can join a table and begin a hand within 2 minutes of
+  entering the lobby.
+- **SC-002**: Table state updates are observed by all seated players within
+  1 second for 95% of actions.
+- **SC-003**: 99% of completed hands produce consistent outcomes across clients
+  when replayed from the event log.
+- **SC-004**: At least 90% of test users can complete a full hand without
+  encountering illegal action prompts.
+- **SC-005**: Chat and moderation actions complete successfully in 95% of trials.
+
+## Assumptions
+
+- Default turn timer is 20 seconds and is not configurable in the MVP.
+- Friends list is stored and displayed but does not include invitations or
+  presence indicators in the MVP.
